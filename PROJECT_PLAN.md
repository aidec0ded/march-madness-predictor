## Development Phases

### Phase 0: Project Scaffolding & Infrastructure

> Foundation — everything else builds on this.

- [x] Initialize Next.js 16 + TypeScript project (App Router)
- [x] Configure Tailwind CSS 4 with dark mode defaults (CSS custom properties, Baseball Savant palette)
- [x] Set up Supabase project (auth + database) — `xiwpovarclryqtkaugsm.supabase.co`, 7 tables, RLS policies applied
- [x] Configure ESLint 9 (flat config) + Prettier
- [x] Set up Vitest 4 + React Testing Library
- [x] Create base directory structure (`src/types/`, `src/lib/`, `src/components/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/app/api/`)
- [x] Configure environment variables (`.env.example` template)
- [x] Set up CI with GitHub Actions (lint + test + build on PR)
- [x] Deploy initial skeleton to Render — `render.yaml` Blueprint, `output: "standalone"`, `.nvmrc` for Node 20

**Parallelizable:** Supabase project setup can happen alongside Next.js scaffolding.

---

### Phase 1: Data Layer & Admin Pipeline

> Get real data flowing before building UI or simulation.

- [x] Define TypeScript interfaces for all team data fields (`src/types/team.ts`, `src/types/data-import.ts`)
- [x] Design Supabase schema (`supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`, `002_rls_policies.sql`)
- [x] Build admin data import API routes (KenPom CSV, Torvik fetch, Evan Miya manual)
- [x] Build Torvik data fetcher (`src/lib/data/fetchers/torvik.ts` — static CSV files from barttorvik.com)
- [x] Build data normalization layer — KenPom, Torvik, Evan Miya normalizers + data merger
- [x] Create admin UI page for data management (`/admin/data`)
- [x] Seed database with 2026 Torvik data (365 teams, programmatic seeder via `scripts/fetch-and-seed.ts`)
- [x] Build campus location lookup for 380+ D-1 schools (`src/lib/data/campus-locations.ts`)
- [x] Write unit tests for data validation and normalization (56 tests total)

**Parallelizable:** Schema design, TypeScript types, and Torvik fetcher are independent.

---

### Phase 2: Core Probability Engine

> The mathematical heart of the application.

- [x] Implement composite rating calculator (weighted KenPom/Torvik/Miya with auto-renormalization)
- [x] Implement log5 logistic model for pairwise win probability (k=0.0325, calibrated)
- [x] Build global lever system — mean-adjusting levers:
  - Four Factors weights (8 sub-levers: offense/defense × 4 factors, scaling factor 0.15)
  - Roster Experience weight (0.75 eff pts / year)
  - Minutes Continuity weight (0.05 eff pts / pct point)
  - Coach Tournament Experience weight (win rate + Final Four bonus)
- [x] Build variance levers:
  - Pace/Tempo effect on distribution width (baseline 68, 0.015 scaling, clamped [0.7, 1.4])
  - Three-Point Rate effect on distribution width (baseline 35%, 0.02 scaling, clamped [0.8, 1.5])
- [x] Build per-matchup override system (inherits globals, deep-merges overrides)
  - Injury/Availability adjustment (efficiency point deduction)
  - Recent Form/Momentum override (-5.0 to +5.0 eff pts)
  - Rest/Schedule Density adjustment (-3.0 to +3.0 eff pts)
- [x] Build site proximity global lever — auto-computed from campus-to-venue distance using continuous exponential decay model (`3.0 × e^(-0.003 × distance)` + travel penalty >1000mi), controlled by `siteProximityWeight` global lever
- [x] Build matchup resolver (`resolveMatchup` — 10-step pipeline, full `ProbabilityBreakdown`)
- [x] Write comprehensive unit tests (96 engine tests, 152 total)
- [ ] ~~Validate against known matchup outcomes for sanity checking~~ → moved to Backlog

**Parallelizable:** Mean levers, variance levers, and per-matchup overrides are independent once the base model exists.

---

### Phase 3: Monte Carlo Simulation Engine ✅

> Full bracket simulation, server-side.

- [x] Define simulation types (`src/types/simulation.ts` — BracketSlot, BracketMatchup, SimulationConfig, SimulationResult, etc.)
- [x] Build bracket structure (`src/lib/engine/bracket.ts` — 63 matchups, 4 regions × 16 seeds, standard NCAA seeding order)
- [x] Implement single-game outcome sampling (`src/lib/engine/sampler.ts` — mulberry32 seeded PRNG for reproducibility)
- [x] Implement full bracket propagation (`src/lib/engine/simulator.ts` — 63 games, forward-propagating with lever effects)
- [x] Build streaming result aggregation (`src/lib/engine/aggregator.ts` — path probabilities, round survival, champion likelihood, upset rates)
- [x] Build simulation API endpoint (`POST /api/simulate` — validates 64-team request, runs simulation, returns results)
- [x] Apply lever effects to simulation parameters (inherits full engine pipeline per game)
- [x] Add configurable simulation count (10K / 25K / 50K / 100K via `SIMULATION_COUNT_OPTIONS`)
- [x] Write comprehensive tests (85 simulation tests: bracket 34, sampler 20, simulator 31; 237 total)
- [ ] ~~Optimize for performance (target: 50K sims in < 5 seconds)~~ → moved to Backlog
- [ ] ~~Add progress reporting for long-running simulations~~ → moved to Backlog

**Dependencies:** Requires Phase 2 (probability engine).

---

### Phase 4: Authentication & User Management ✅

> User accounts, bracket persistence, saved configurations.

- [x] Integrate Supabase Auth with Next.js — four-client pattern (`@supabase/ssr`), middleware for session refresh + route protection
- [x] Build sign-up / sign-in pages (email + OAuth providers) — `/auth/sign-in`, `/auth/sign-up`, `/auth/forgot-password`, `/auth/reset-password`
- [x] Add OAuth callback and email confirmation route handlers (`/auth/callback`, `/auth/confirm`)
- [x] Create AuthProvider context with server-side initial user hydration + `useAuth` hook
- [x] Design schema for user data: `user_brackets`, `user_lever_configs`, `user_settings` (`003_user_tables.sql`)
- [x] Implement bracket save/load API routes (`GET/POST /api/brackets`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/brackets/[id]`)
- [x] Implement lever configuration save/load (`GET/POST /api/lever-configs`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/lever-configs/[id]`)
- [x] Implement settings API route with upsert pattern (`GET/PUT /api/settings`)
- [x] Set up Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies — `auth.uid() = user_id` with admin override
- [x] Build user settings page (`/settings`) — pool size bucket, simulation count preferences
- [x] Transition admin auth to dual Supabase Auth + API key fallback
- [ ] ~~Write auth integration tests~~ → moved to Backlog

**Parallelizable with Phase 2 and Phase 3** — auth is independent of the engine.

---

### Phase 5: Bracket View UI ✅

> The primary screen — data-dense, dark, smooth.

- [x] Build 64-team bracket layout component (responsive, all four regions + Final Four) — `BracketGrid`, `RegionBracket`, `FinalFour` with CSS Grid layout + connector lines
- [x] Build team card component (name, seed, probability bars) — `TeamCard` (React.memo, seed badge color-coded), `ProbabilityBar` (3px color-interpolated bar)
- [x] Implement interactive bracket picking (click to advance team) — `BracketProvider` with `useReducer`, cascading pick invalidation on upstream changes
- [x] Build global lever panel (collapsible sidebar/drawer) — `LeverPanel` with `CompositeWeightsControl` (auto-normalization), `FourFactorsControls` (8 sliders), `VarianceControls`
- [x] Build simulation trigger button with loading/progress state — `SimulationButton` with idle/loading/success/error states, `useBracketSimulation` hook
- [x] Display simulation results overlay (champion probabilities, round survival) — `SimulationResultsOverlay` with top 10 champions table, upset rates, execution metadata
- [x] Implement dark mode theme system (Baseball Savant inspired) — CSS custom properties throughout, all components use `--bg-*`, `--text-*`, `--accent-*` variables
- [x] Add visual indicators for matchups with per-matchup overrides — `OverrideIndicator` orange dot with tooltip
- [x] Connect `/api/simulate` to Supabase — `transforms.ts` for DB row → `TeamSeason` conversion, endpoint fetches 64 teams and runs engine
- [x] Build `/bracket` page (Server Component) with team fetching and optional saved bracket loading
- [x] Build bracket save/load persistence — `useBracketPersistence` hook connected to brackets API
- [ ] ~~Responsive design polish (tablet horizontal scroll, mobile region-by-region view)~~ → moved to Backlog
- [ ] ~~Add bracket-specific unit/component tests~~ → moved to Backlog

**Dependencies:** Requires Phase 2 (lever system), Phase 3 (simulation results to display), Phase 4 (save/load).

---

### Phase 6: Matchup View UI ✅

> Deep-dive "film room" for individual games.

- [x] Build team statistical profile card component — `TeamProfileCard` showing efficiency ratings, four factors, shooting splits, tempo, experience, coaching
- [x] Build side-by-side comparison layout — `StatComparison` with 15 metrics grouped by category (efficiency, four factors, shooting, other) with advantage coloring
- [x] Build per-matchup lever override panel (shows inherited defaults, allows override) — `MatchupOverridePanel` with sliders for injury, site proximity, recent form, rest
- [x] Display win probability before and after overrides — `ProbabilityDisplay` with large probability numbers, point spread, and full breakdown table
- [x] Build Monte Carlo distribution visualization (histogram/density chart) — `DistributionChart` using Recharts with margin-of-victory bins color-split at 0
- [x] Navigation: bracket view ↔ matchup view with context preservation — Full-screen `MatchupView` overlay triggered by clicking any matchup, closes on Escape key
- [x] Charting library integration — Recharts installed and integrated
- [x] Build shared bracket-utils — Extracted `resolveSlotTeam()` and `resolveMatchupTeams()` into shared `bracket-utils.ts`
- [x] Build distribution generator — `generateMatchupDistribution()` mini Monte Carlo (1000 samples), Box-Muller normal noise
- [x] Build useMatchupAnalysis hook — Resolves teams, runs probability with/without overrides, generates distribution
- [x] Write tests (8 distribution generator tests, 245 total passing)

**Dependencies:** Requires Phase 5 (bracket navigation context).

---

### Phase 7: Game Theory / Contest Mode ✅

> Strategic layer — pool size shapes recommendations.

- [x] Build pool size selection UI — `PoolSizeSelector` compact dropdown in header bar, dispatches `SET_POOL_SIZE` to BracketContext
- [x] Implement ownership model — seed-based baseline (1-seed: 98%, 16-seed: 2%) × round decay (R64: 1.0 → NCG: 0.3) × conference premium (power +4%) × rating-strength adjustment
- [x] Build strategy recommendation engine — 4 pool tiers (small/medium/large/very_large), leverage score = winProb / (ownership/100), typed recommendations (max_probability, contrarian_value, slight_contrarian, avoid, neutral)
- [x] Display ownership estimates alongside win probabilities in bracket view — `OwnershipBadge` (memo-wrapped) inline on `TeamCard`, color-coded by ownership level
- [x] Add `poolSizeBucket` to BracketState + `SET_POOL_SIZE` action
- [x] Wire ownership through BracketGrid → RegionBracket → MatchupSlot → TeamCard + FinalFour
- [x] Build `useContestStrategy` hook with memoized `getOwnership()` and `getRecommendation()` functions
- [x] Write tests (27 new: 9 ownership + 18 strategy, 264 total passing)
- [x] Feed contest context into AI narrative recommendations (completed in Phase 9)

**Parallelizable with Phase 6 and Phase 8.**

---

### Phase 8: Contextual Guidance System ✅

> Proactive warnings and insights without restricting choice.

- [x] Build guidance rules engine — 6 pure-function rules evaluating BracketState → GuidanceMessage[]:
  - Upset volume warning — counts R64 upsets vs historical avg (~4), warning >6, danger ≥8
  - Chalk concentration warning — % picks matching higher seed, warning ≥80%, danger ≥90%
  - Variance mismatch note — flags teams with 3PT rate ≥38% picked to S16+
  - Lever conflict detection — high experience/continuity/coach weight vs team profile contradiction
  - Recency divergence flag — |recentForm override| > 2.0 or rating sources disagree >5 pts
  - Pace/tempo explanation — slow-paced teams (<64 adj tempo) in R64 upset picks
- [x] Build guidance evaluator pipeline — runs all rules, catches errors, deduplicates by ID, sorts by severity (danger > warning > info)
- [x] Build `GuidancePanel` component — collapsible panel with color-coded messages (danger/warning/info), category icons, individual dismiss support
- [x] Build `useGuidance` hook — memoized, builds GuidanceContext from BracketState, recomputes on picks/levers/overrides/simulation changes
- [x] Integrate into BracketShell — "Guidance" toggle button in header bar
- [x] Write comprehensive tests (37 new tests across 7 files, 274 total passing)

**Parallelizable with Phase 7.**

---

### Phase 9: AI Matchup Narrative ✅

> Claude-powered analysis in the matchup view.

- [x] Build Claude API integration (`POST /api/narrative` — SSE streaming via Anthropic SDK, `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, 1024 max tokens)
- [x] Engineer prompt template:
  - Structured team data payload (`buildTeamDataBlock()` — all stats from TeamSeason in labeled format)
  - Data dictionary for field interpretation (`src/lib/narrative/data-dictionary.ts` — baselines, interaction effects)
  - Reasoning instructions for interaction effects (6 documented interaction patterns)
  - 1 few-shot example output for style/structure (`src/lib/narrative/examples.ts`)
  - Constraints (no speculation, must recommend, under 600 words, 5-section format)
- [x] Build narrative display component (`NarrativePanel` — generate button, streaming text, lightweight markdown renderer)
- [x] Add generation trigger (button, not auto-generate — "Generate Analysis" with sparkle icon)
- [x] Implement response caching (module-level `Map<hash, text>` in `useMatchupNarrative`, keyed by djb2 hash of data inputs)
- [x] Rate limiting / cost controls (in-memory `Map<userId, {count, resetAt}>`, 10 req/min per user)
- [x] Incorporate contest mode context into prompt (ownership %, leverage scores, pool strategy description)
- [x] Write prompt builder tests (28 tests, 337 total passing)

**Implementation notes:**
- 8 new files: `src/types/narrative.ts`, `src/lib/narrative/data-dictionary.ts`, `src/lib/narrative/examples.ts`, `src/lib/narrative/prompt-builder.ts`, `src/lib/narrative/prompt-builder.test.ts`, `src/app/api/narrative/route.ts`, `src/hooks/useMatchupNarrative.ts`, `src/components/matchup/NarrativePanel.tsx`
- 3 modified files: `src/types/matchup-view.ts` (+`rawBreakdown`), `src/hooks/useMatchupAnalysis.ts` (populate rawBreakdown), `src/components/matchup/MatchupView.tsx` (+NarrativePanel)
- Prompt structure: system message (role + rules + data dictionary) + user message (team blocks + matchup context + pool context + examples + instruction)
- 5-section output format: Rating Profile, Stylistic Matchup, Key Factors, How This Game Plays Out, Recommendation
- NarrativePanel states: idle → generating (streaming with blinking cursor) → complete / error
- `@anthropic-ai/sdk` added as dependency

**Dependencies:** Requires Phase 6 (matchup view to display in), Phase 7 (contest context for prompt).

---

### Phase 10: Backtesting Module ✅

> Model validation and lever tuning against history.

- [x] Source and format historical data — scraped 2008–2024 from sports-reference.com (1,007 games across 16 seasons)
- [x] Build historical data import pipeline — `scripts/scrape-tournament-results.ts` → `src/lib/backtest/historical-results.ts`

**Completed: 63 backtest tests, 400 total tests passing.**

---

### Phase 11: Polish, Performance & Production ✅

> Ship it.

- [x] Error boundaries and graceful failure handling — `global-error.tsx`, `error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`, bracket/backtest-specific boundaries
- [x] Loading states — `loading.tsx` skeletons for all routes (bracket grid skeleton, backtest chart skeleton, spinner fallbacks)
- [x] Lazy loading for heavy components — `MatchupView`, `BrierScoreChart`, `CalibrationPlot` via `next/dynamic` with `ChartSkeleton` fallbacks
- [x] Security headers — HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy via `next.config.ts`

## Backlog

> Prioritized work queue. Items are grouped into execution batches.

### Batch 1 — Testing Gaps & Skill _(parallel)_ ✅

- [x] **Auth integration tests** — 9 test files, 56 tests covering sign-in/up/forgot/reset password, AuthProvider, API routes, middleware
- [x] **Bracket component tests** — 11 test files, 152 tests covering TeamCard, ProbabilityBar, OwnershipBadge, MatchupSlot, SimulationButton, BracketProvider, PoolSizeSelector, GuidancePanel, SimulationResultsOverlay, BracketShell
- [x] `/backtest-year [year]` skill — `.claude/skills/backtest-year/SKILL.md` — full backtesting workflow with 8-step process

### Batch 2 — Matchup Bug Fix ✅

- [x] **Defensive metrics display bug** — Root cause: `num()` in transforms.ts converted NULL → 0, masking missing data. Fix: made `fourFactorsDefense` and `shootingDefense` nullable on TeamSeason; transforms return null when all DB fields are NULL; engine skips four factors adjustment when defensive data is missing; UI shows "—" instead of 0.0%
- [x] **Defensive data overwrite bug** — Root cause: KenPom commit route always included defensive columns (`def_efg_pct`, etc.) in its upsert, even when the defense CSV wasn't uploaded; `nanToNull(undefined?.efgPct)` → `null` overwrote Torvik-provided defensive data. Fix: applied conditional-include pattern (same approach Torvik already used for height/experience) to all three import paths — KenPom commit, Torvik commit, and fetch-and-seed script. Defensive columns are now only included in the upsert when actual data is present.

### Batch 3 — Teams API ✅

- [x] **Teams API route: connected to Supabase** — `GET /api/teams` now queries `team_seasons` (joined with `teams` and `coaches`) plus `tournament_entries`, transforms via `transformTeamSeasonRows()`, and returns fully-hydrated TeamSeason objects. Supports `?season=`, `?teamId=`, `?tournamentOnly=true` filters. Default season 2026. Tournament entries error is non-fatal. 11 new tests in `route.test.ts`.

### Batch 4 — Data Ingestion _(sequential)_

- [x] **Populate real 2026 bracket teams** — Tournament bracket population admin tooling, tournament entries seeded via admin panel
- [x] **Historical tournament data for backtesting** — Kaggle March Machine Learning Mania dataset integrated, historical tournament results scraped and seeded
- [x] **Coach data ingestion** — Kaggle tournament results pipeline (`scripts/seed-coaches.ts`), `--all-seasons` flag for historical data, coach table with win/loss/F4/championship records
- [x] **Tournament venue / location data** — Admin API (`POST/GET/DELETE /api/admin/tournament-sites`), `tournament_sites` Supabase table, `buildSiteMap()` for round/region→venue mapping, continuous exponential decay distance model for site proximity global lever, auto-computed from campus-to-venue haversine distance
- [x] **NET Ranking / Strength of Schedule lever** — `sosWeight` global lever (default 1.0) with `sosNetRating` data field, `calculateSosAdjustment()` in engine, "Strength of Schedule" slider in LeverPanel Schedule & Luck section
- [x] **Luck regression lever** — `luckRegressionWeight` global lever (default 1.0) with `luck` data field (KenPom), `calculateLuckRegressionAdjustment()` in engine (8.0 eff pts scaling), "Luck Regression" slider in LeverPanel Schedule & Luck section
- [x] **2-Foul Participation editability** — No longer needed as a per-matchup override; data is ingested via the stats upload script and displayed read-only in TeamProfileCard. Used for narrative context.

### Batch 5 — Model Validation & Backtest Parity ✅

- [x] **Validate model against known outcomes** — Sanity-check engine predictions against historical matchup results
- [x] **Align backtest levers with global bracket levers** — Backtest lever configuration should match the full set of global lever options from the bracket, so users can test their bracket lever configuration against historical data

### Batch 6 — UX Clarity & Guidance _(sequential)_

- [x] **Per-matchup override guidance** — Added calibration hints to all 5 override sections in MatchupOverridePanel: Injury/Availability (role player through star player ranges), Recent Form (hot streak, skid, dramatic surge), Rest/Schedule (extra rest, conf. tourney fatigue), Bench Depth and Pace Adjustment (weight scale guidance). Hints display as italic muted text below each section description.
- [x] **Clarify probability numbers on team cards** — Bracket cards now show per-game head-to-head win probabilities (via `resolveMatchup()`), available immediately when both teams are known. Simulation path probabilities shown as tooltips. New `useGameProbabilities` hook computes probabilities for all 63 games.
- [x] **Picked-team probability mismatch** — Fixed: bracket view and matchup view now show the same per-game win probability from `resolveMatchup()`. Path probability (P of advancing through this round from simulation) is shown separately in tooltips and in the matchup view's ProbabilityDisplay.
- [x] **Simulation workflow clarity** — Implemented 5 improvements: (1) Stale simulation indicator — tracks input hash to detect when picks/levers/overrides change after simulation, shows "Re-run Simulation" with amber dot; (2) Tooltip on SimulationButton explaining what simulation does vs. per-game probabilities; (3) "Run simulation" prompt in ProbabilityDisplay when path probabilities are unavailable; (4) Auto-open results overlay after first simulation; (5) Explanatory header in SimulationResultsOverlay describing methodology. Stale banner in results overlay warns when results are outdated.
- [x] **Ownership model transparency** — Enhanced OwnershipBadge tooltip to mention 4 factors (seed position, round depth, conference profile, rating strength). Created collapsible OwnershipExplainer component in matchup view documenting all 4 ownership factors with specific values from the model (seed baselines, round decay multipliers, conference premiums, rating adjustment range). Includes disclaimer that estimates are heuristic.
- [x] **Backtest results interpretation guide** — Created collapsible BacktestInterpretationGuide component rendered at top of backtest dashboard. Covers 5 topics: Brier Score (scale, interpretation ranges), Model vs. Baseline (what seed-only baseline means), Train vs. Test (why test matters more, overfitting risk), Calibration Chart (diagonal, over/under-confidence, point size), 2021 Anomaly (COVID bubble context).

### Batch 7 — Performance & Polish _(parallel)_ ✅

- [x] **Simulation performance optimization** — Two-tier caching + fast path: `resolveMatchupFast()` returns only probability number (skipping all ProbabilityBreakdown diagnostic allocation), `MatchupCache` Map wrapper deduplicates (teamA, teamB) pairs across simulations (at most ~2,016 unique pairings for 64 teams). Cache only stores results for games without per-matchup overrides. `simulateBracket()` checks cache before computing, falls back to fast path. Targets <5s for 50K sims.
- [x] **Simulation progress reporting** — SSE streaming via ReadableStream. New `/api/simulate/stream` endpoint sends `progress` events every 1,000 sims with `{completed, total, elapsedMs}` and a final `result` event. `runSimulation()` accepts optional `onProgress` callback and `progressInterval`. Frontend: `useBracketSimulation` hook consumes SSE stream with TextDecoder, dispatches `SET_SIMULATION_PROGRESS` actions into BracketProvider state. `SimulationButton` shows "Simulating... XX%" label + thin 2px progress bar at button bottom during streaming.
- [x] **Performance audit** — Installed `@next/bundle-analyzer` with `ANALYZE=true` env var wrapper in `next.config.ts`. Added `"analyze"` npm script. Created `scripts/perf-benchmark.ts` measuring `runSimulation()` at 1K/5K/10K/25K/50K with median/P95/min/max/sims-per-sec. Added `Server-Timing` header to `/api/simulate` response. Documented targets and reproduction steps in `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`.
- [x] **Responsive / mobile design polish** — Three breakpoints: desktop (≥1024px) unchanged, tablet (768–1023px) scroll affordance gradient, mobile (<768px) region-by-region tabbed view. Created `useMediaQuery` hook (SSR-safe, returns false during hydration) with `MOBILE_QUERY`/`TABLET_QUERY` constants. `MobileBracketView` component with 5 tabs (East/West/South/Midwest/Final 4), proper ARIA tablist/tab/tabpanel roles. `BracketGrid` delegates to MobileBracketView on mobile. `BracketShell` responsive header (condensed padding/fonts, hidden bracket name on mobile). `LeverPanel` full-width drawer (100vw) on mobile. Added `--border-primary` CSS variable, scroll affordance gradient, and mobile tab bar styles to globals.css.

### Batch 8 — Infrastructure & Tooling

- [ ] **Custom domain setup** — Configure custom domain on deployment provider (Render)
- [ ] **Fix Vitest / Vite ESM compatibility** — Vitest 4.0.x CJS entrypoint cannot `require()` ESM-only Vite 7.x; likely fix is adding `"type": "module"` to `package.json` or pinning Vite to v6

### Batch 9 — Documentation & Guides

- [ ] **Comprehensive User Guide update** — Flesh out `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` with: simulation workflow documentation (when to run, what it adds beyond per-game probabilities, interpreting results), lever explanations with calibration guidance, game theory strategy guide by pool size, matchup view walkthrough, and interpretation guidance for all probability numbers
